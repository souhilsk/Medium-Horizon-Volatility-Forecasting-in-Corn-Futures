# Medium-Horizon Volatility Forecasting in Corn Futures

This repository contains the final project for my **Machine Learning in Financial Engineering** course.

The project studies **medium-horizon (30-day) volatility forecasting** for corn futures, comparing:
- Economically motivated linear models  
- Option-implied volatility benchmarks  
- LSTM-based sequence models  
- A hybrid Linear Regression + LSTM approach  

The goal is to assess whether machine learning models can deliver incremental predictive value over strong, economically grounded baselines at a one-month forecasting horizon.

## Contents
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Linear benchmark models
- LSTM and hybrid model implementations
- Out-of-sample evaluation and comparison

The full write-up and results are presented in the accompanying paper:
